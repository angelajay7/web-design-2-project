    <h1>Welcome To Ging's Garden</h2>
    <p>This website is an amalgamation of all of my favourite things related to the Pokemon franchise. In my 24 years on earth, I have played my fair share of Pokemon generations, my childhood favourite being Sapphire on my Gameboy Advanced. Eventually I graduated through to Pearl, White, and Soul Silver on my DS lite. If you can't already tell, I had an older sibling who got first pick when a new generation duo was released. After a long hiatus, I was recently gifted a switch lite and have been able to play and enjoy Pokemon again through Scarlet. Ever since I was young, beating the game with the strongest possible Pokemon has never been my goal. I enjoy catching cute Pokemon, growing berries </p>

      <h2>Little Cuties</h2>
      <p>These Pokemon hold the spot for my top three cutest in my personal opinion. These are the Pokemon that I have loved since I was little and I rank a solid 5/5 stars on the cutie ranking system.</p>
      <div class="jigglypuff">
        <img src="images/jigglypuff.png" alt="photo of Jigglypuff Pokemon"/>
        <p>An expected but honest first place has to go to Jigglypuff. As a child I would spend hours catching as many as I could so that I would have entire PC boxes filled with just Jigglypuffs. Round, pink, curly front bang, sings you to sleep. There is nothing I would change about this little Pokemon.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="vulpix">
        <img src="images/vulpix.png" alt="Photo of Vulpix Pokemon"/>
        <p> Vulpix was the Pokemon I wanted most to exist in real life. It is all around perfect with it's cute tail and white belly. In Pokemon Sapphire I would spend much of my time on Mt. Pyre searching for this little Fire-type cutie. I also think the evolution, Ninetails, is very special as well.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="Togepi">
        <img src="images/togepi.png" alt="Photo of Togepi Pokemon"/>
        <p>Togepi is another expected cutie for obvious reasons. Of course Misty was an icon to me growing up, and I often longed to cradle and go on Adventures with a small Togepi just like she did. The almost 80's like design on this Pokemon's shell, along with the cute way it walks around is more than enough to earn a spot on my top 3 cutest little Pokemon list. /p>

      <h2>Big Jambas</h2>
      <p>These Pokemon are what I consider to be the top 3 biggest and best Jambas in my experience. These Pokemon are large, round, and often strong. I also rate them 5/5 stars on my Big Jamba scale.</p>
      <div class="snorlax">
      <img src="images/snorlax.png" alt="Photo of Snorlax pokemon"/>
      <p>Snorlax is the quintessential Big Jamba. If you were confused about the definition before, just take a look at this Pokemon, and you will understand. A description of Snorlax from the Ruby and Sapphire Pokedex is: "Snorlax's typical day consists of nothing more than eating and sleeping. It is such a docile Pokémon that there are children who use its expansive belly as a place to play." </p>
    </div>

    <div class="swampert">
      <img src="images/swampert.png" alt="Photo of Swampert pokemon"/>
      <p>Swampert is the final evolution of Mudkip, which was my starter Pokemon when I played Sapphire. I think this is a big factor to why it is in my top three Biggest Jambas. Swampert and I have been through everything together, and I feel like it would protect me from danger in real life situations by sheilding me with it's big body. Those gills and that stance are signs of a true Big Jamba.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="Nidoqueen">
      <img src="images/nidoqueen.png" alt="Photo of Nidoqueen Pokemon"/>
      <p>Nidoqueen is the smallest of the Big 3 Jambas, but a Jamba nonetheless. She is one of my favourites because I like that they intentionally made the female version blue, and the male one pink. Not that that has anything to do with Jambaness, but it is a detail I enjoyed as a child and made Nidoqueen stick out in my memory all these years. The Pokedex description of Nidoqueen from Sapphire is "	Nidoqueen's body is encased in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young."</p>

    <h2>Other things that I think are Cute</h2>
    <p>This section consists of other aspects of the Pokemon franchise that are not actual Pokemon, but I still think deserve recognition for being cute. These events, objects, and attributes are memorable pieces of different games that I loved.</p>

    <div class="mail">
      <img src="images/Tropic_Mail.png" alt="Photo of Tropic Mail in Pokemon">
      <p>Pictured is one of the decorated letter pages that you can send as mail in Generation III pokemon games. This one is titled Tropic mail and features Bellossom. I loved to write different messages and give them to my Pokemon to hold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="base">
      <img src="images/BASE.png" alt="Photo of Underground Pokemon Base">
      <p>The Hoenn region has 75 different locations where you can make and decorate your own Secret Base. To be able to enter these hideouts, you must have a Pokemon that can use th TM Secret Power. Bases can be decorated to your liking with a limit of 16 decorations. I have made an example of a possible set up, pictured here. I gravitate towards to the tree and shrub layouts most, but various coloured cave hideouts exist as well. "click here for more" --link to bulbapedia??** </p>
