    <h1>Welcome To Ging's Garden</h2>
    <p>This website is an amalgamation of all of my favourite things related to the Pokemon franchise. In my 24 years on earth, I have played my fair share of Pokemon generations, my childhood favourite being Sapphire on my Gameboy Advanced. Eventually I graduated through to Pearl, White, and Soul Silver on my DS lite. If you can't already tell, I had an older sibling who got first pick when a new generation duo was released. After a long hiatus, I was recently gifted a switch lite and have been able to play and enjoy Pokemon again through Scarlet. Ever since I was young, beating the game with the strongest possible Pokemon has never been my goal. I enjoy catching cute Pokemon, growing berries </p>

      <h2>Little Cuties</h2>
      <p>These Pokemon hold the spot for my top three cutest in my personal opinion. These are the Pokemon that I have loved since I was little and I rank a solid 5/5 stars on the cutie ranking system.</p>
