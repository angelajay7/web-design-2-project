      <h1>Welcome To Ging's Garden</h2>
        <p>This website is an amalgamation of all of my favourite things related to the Pokemon franchise. In my 24
          years on earth, I have played my fair share of Pokemon generations, my childhood favourite being Sapphire on
          my Gameboy Advanced. Eventually I graduated through to Pearl, White, and Soul Silver on my DS lite. If you
          can't already tell, I had an older sibling who got first pick when a new generation duo was released. After a
          long hiatus, I was recently gifted a switch lite and have been able to play and enjoy Pokemon again through
          Scarlet. Ever since I was young, beating the game with the strongest possible Pokemon has never been my goal.
          I enjoy catching cute Pokemon, growing berries, and enjoying all the visually pleasing pixels the games have to offer. <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

        <h3>Little Cuties</h3>
        <p>These Pokemon hold the spot for my top three cutest in my personal opinion. These are the Pokemon that I have
          loved since I was little and I rank a solid 5/5 stars on the cutie ranking system. <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

                catching_pokemon
                </span>Jigglypuff</h2>
          <p>An expected but honest first place has to go to Jigglypuff. As a child I would spend hours catching as many
            as I could so that I would have entire PC boxes filled with just Jigglypuffs. Round, pink, curly front bang,
            sings you to sleep. There is nothing I would change about this little Pokemon. <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

          <h2><span class=" pb material-icons-outlined">
            catching_pokemon
            </span>Vulpix</h2>
          <p> Vulpix was the Pokemon I wanted most to exist in real life. It is all around perfect with it's cute tail
            and white belly. In Pokemon Sapphire I would spend much of my time on Mt. Pyre searching for this little
            Fire-type cutie. I also think the evolution, Ninetails, is very special as well. <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

            catching_pokemon
            </span>Togepi</h2>
          <p>Togepi is another expected cutie for obvious reasons. Of course Misty was an icon to me growing up, and I
            often longed to cradle and go on Adventures with a small Togepi just like she did. The almost 80's like
            design on this Pokemon's shell... <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

        <h3>Big Jambas</h3>
        <p>These Pokemon are what I consider to be the top 3 biggest and best Jambas in my experience. These Pokemon are
          large, round, and often strong. I also rate them 5/5 stars on my Big Jamba scale. <span class="down material-icons-outlined">
            arrow_drop_down

        <div class="snorlax">

          <h2><span class=" pb material-icons-outlined">
            catching_pokemon
            </span>Snorlax</h2>
          <p>Snorlax is the quintessential Big Jamba. If you were confused about the definition before, just take a look
            at this Pokemon, and you will understand. A description of Snorlax from the Ruby and Sapphire Pokedex is:
            "Snorlax's typical day consists of nothing more than eating and sleeping. It is such a docile Pokémon that
            there are children who use its expansive belly as a place to play." <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

        <div class="swampert">

          <h2><span class=" pb material-icons-outlined">
            catching_pokemon
            </span>Swampert</h2>
          <p>Swampert is the final evolution of Mudkip, which was my starter Pokemon when I played Sapphire. I think
            this is a big factor to why it is in my top three Biggest Jambas. Swampert and I have been through
            everything together, and I feel like it would protect me from danger in real life situations by sheilding me
            with it's big body. Those gills and that stance are signs of a true Big Jamba. <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

          <h2><span class=" pb material-icons-outlined">
            catching_pokemon
            </span>Nidoqueen</h2>
          <p>Nidoqueen is the smallest of the Big 3 Jambas, but a Jamba nonetheless. She is one of my favourites because
            I like that they intentionally made the female version blue, and the male one pink. Not that that has
            anything to do with Jambaness, but it is a detail I enjoyed as a child and made Nidoqueen stick out in my
            memory all these years. The Pokedex description of Nidoqueen from Sapphire is " Nidoqueen's body is encased
            in extremely hard scales. It is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles. This Pokémon is at its
            strongest when it is defending its young." <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

      <h3>Other things that I think are Cute</h3>
      <p>This section consists of other aspects of the Pokemon franchise that are not actual Pokemon, but I still think
        deserve recognition for being cute. These events, objects, and attributes are memorable pieces of different
        games that I loved.<span class="down material-icons-outlined">

          one is titled Tropic mail and features Bellossom. I loved to write different messages and give them to my
          Pokemon to hold. <span class="down material-icons-outlined">

        <h2>Secret Bases</h2>
        <p>The Hoenn region has 75 different locations where you can make and decorate your own Secret Base. To be able
          to enter these hideouts, you must have a Pokemon that can use th TM Secret Power. Bases can be decorated to
          your liking with a limit of 16 decorations. I have made an example of a possible set up, pictured here. I
          gravitate towards to the tree and shrub layouts most, but various coloured cave hideouts exist as well. "click
